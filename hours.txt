Spent time report

2  hours to create project, set up jest, create a basic structure.
2 hours to create a basic layout, implement lazy load.
6 hours implement ngrx, resolving troubles of work and researching about it
2 hour to create unit testing cases with jest.


With more time I would have done:
Mock with data.json to consume from effects and give to app.
Improve unit testing cases.
Improve the ui with another design.
Research more about entities in NgRx.
